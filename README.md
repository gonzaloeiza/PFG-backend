### Technologies

---

A list of technologies used within this **API REST** project:

- [NODE JS](https://nodejs.org/): Version 16.14.0
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): Version 8.5.4
- [MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com/): Version 5.5

<a name="instalation"></a>

### Instalation

---

The first step to begin with the instalation is to install the necessary dependencies that are used:

```
npm i
```

The next step is to create the MYSQL database and the user that will be used, and give the user the correct permissions in order to interact with the database:

```
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS padelDB;
CREATE SCHEMA padelDB;
DROP USER IF EXISTS 'deployer'@'%';
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'deployer'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'deployer';
GRANT ALL ON padelDB.* TO 'deployer'@'%';
```

Before starting to run the scripts, you must configure an .env file. You have an example (/.env.example) on the source code with the required variables.

Then, yo might want to insert some examples to the databse, which will also create the default administrator account:

```
npm run insertExamplesDB
```

The credentials to access as the administrator are:

- email: admin@gmail.com
- password: 12345678

You can now run the application with the next command:

```
npm start
```

You cant test that the application runs correctly by accessing to: http://localhost:5000.

If you want to execute the FRONTEND appliaction, go to the [FRONTEND REPOSITORY](https://github.com/gonzaloeiza/PFG-frontend) and follow the instructions.

You can test everything works correctly by logging as an user with this credentials:

- email: eizaguirregonzalo@gmail.com
- password: 12345678
